So I created something very similar to this a couple of years ago, but seemed to fall into the trap of having an overly complicated setup than was needed (it used docker and was complex enough that my first post was actually how to set the damn thing up again) followed by never writing another post again.  Here's my second attempt at this.

The plan isn't for this to be some rambling blog where I put the world to rights or complain how McDonalds got the familay order wrong again, but more a place for me to put notes and ideas that I find myself searching the web for again and again.  Things like simple script templates for loading files or grabbing URLs in Python, creating a nice build in Docker, etc.

Also, with my renewed (and, amazingly, not yet abandoned) interest in making music, I will hopefully have a few things to write about that when I can make a success of writing something again - so far I've done one basic synthwave-esque song, but I have loftier expectations of myself that I hope to fail to achieve in the near future.
